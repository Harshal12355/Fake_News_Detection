# Fake News Detection Project

This project is a fully end-to-end fake news detection system. It takes news articles and classifies them as either true or fake using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains raw and processed data files.
  - `raw/`:
    - `True.csv`: Contains true news articles.
    - `False.csv`: Contains fake news articles.
  - `processed/`:
    - `combined.csv`: Cleaned and combined dataset for training.
    - `features.pkl`: Extracted features from the text.
    - `vectorizer.pkl`: TF-IDF vectorizer used for feature extraction.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- **`src/`**: Contains source code for various components.
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Scripts for loading, cleaning, and saving data.
  - `feature_extraction.py`: Scripts for feature extraction from text data.
  - `model_training.py`: Scripts for training and saving the model.
  - `model_evaluation.py`: Scripts for evaluating the model’s performance.
  - `model_deployment.py`: Scripts for deploying the model as a Flask API.
- **`models/`**: Contains the saved trained model.
  - `trained_model.pkl`: Pickle file of the trained model.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies required for the project.
- **`README.md`**: This file.
- **`setup.py`**: Setup script for project configuration.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harshal12355/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   Run the following command to preprocess the data:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   After data preprocessing, extract features using:
   ```bash
   python src/feature_extraction.py
   ```

3. **Model Training**:
   Train the model using:
   ```bash
   python src/model_training.py
   ```

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   Evaluate the model's performance with:
   ```bash
   python src/model_evaluation.py
   ```

5. **Model Deployment**:
   To deploy the model as a Flask API, run:
   ```bash
   python src/model_deployment.py
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict`. You can send a POST request with a JSON payload like:
   ```json
   {
     "text": "Sample news article text"
   }
   ```

## Files and Folders

- **`data/`**: Holds raw and processed data.
- **`notebooks/`**: Contains notebooks for development.
- **`src/`**: Contains source code.
- **`models/`**: Stores the trained model.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists Python package dependencies.
